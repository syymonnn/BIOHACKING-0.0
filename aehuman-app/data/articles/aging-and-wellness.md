Healthy Aging and Wellness

The declines with age are far more related to a lifetime of unenlightened choices than to the ticking of a clock【616081394139150†L150-L155】. Pathologic aging, caused by disease, is different from normal aging【616081394139150†L156-L160】. By making informed, evidence-based choices and adopting preventive strategies, we can slow and normalize the aging process and maintain our functional abilities【616081394139150†L161-L165】.

### Whole-person approach

Optimizing whole-person well-being means attending to physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual dimensions【616081394139150†L124-L131】. Self-care and evidence-based decisions help prevent, delay, or minimize age-related decline【616081394139150†L134-L146】.
