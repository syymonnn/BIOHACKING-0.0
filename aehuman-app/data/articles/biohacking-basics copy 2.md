Biohacking Basics: An Introduction

Biohacking is the process of implementing scientifically-driven lifestyle interventions to optimize health throughout the lifespan. It encompasses both incremental and radical changes to diet, lifestyle, or supplementation, all with the goal of improving your wellbeing. Because biohacking is a personalized process, self-experimentation and data collection are key to finding what works for you.

### The Scientific Method

Biohacking follows a method similar to the scientific method. Start by defining the problem you want to address, create a hypothesis on how a specific intervention might help, measure your baseline, test the intervention, evaluate the results, and refine your approach. Using technology like wearables and blood tests allows you to track objective measures and see the impact of your biohacks.
