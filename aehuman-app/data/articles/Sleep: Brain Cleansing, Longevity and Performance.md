# Why Sleep is *Active* (and Decisive)

Sleep is not “wasted time”: at night the **brain increases >60% of interstitial space**, promoting convective flow of fluids that **clear metabolites** like **β-amyloid** — a possible mechanism of neural “self-cleaning” (glymphatic system). [Xie et al., *Science*, 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3880190/)  
**Adults should sleep ≥7 hours/night** on a regular basis for optimal health; chronic <7 h sleep is associated with adverse outcomes (metabolic, cardiovascular, injury risk). [AASM/SRS Consensus, 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4434546/); [CDC, 2024](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html)

## Brain: self-cleaning, memory, attention

- **Glymphatic & brain “detox.”** In sleep (or anesthesia) the **interstitial space expands ~60%**, accelerating clearance of solutes including β-amyloid. [Xie 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3880190/)  
- **Memory.** Sleep — especially **slow-wave sleep (SWS)** — **optimizes consolidation** of memory traces (learning is more efficient after adequate sleep). [Rasch & Born, *Physiol Rev*, 2013](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/physrev.00032.2012)  
- **Attention & vigilance.** **Chronic restriction** to **6 h/night for 14 days** produces **cognitive deficits comparable to 1–2 nights of total deprivation**, with progressive lapses on the PVT. [Van Dongen et al., *Sleep*, 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12683469/)

## Body: immunity, cardiometabolism, mortality

- **Immunity.** Sleeping **≤6 h** increases by about **4×** the likelihood of developing a **cold** after controlled rhinovirus exposure (actigraphy + inoculation). [Prather et al., *Sleep*, 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4531403/)  
- **Cardiometabolism & regularity.** **Irregular patterns** of sleep duration/timing are associated with **higher cardiometabolic risk** (CHD, hypertension, obesity, diabetes). [Zhang et al., *Front Endocrinol*, 2023 – review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9981680/)  
- **Longevity (U-shape).** Both **short** and **long** sleep are associated with **increased all-cause mortality** in prospective cohorts (meta-analysis). [Cappuccio et al., *Sleep*, 2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2864873/)

## What sabotages sleep (with data)

- **Evening screens.** Reading on a **backlit e-reader** before bed **suppresses melatonin**, **delays the circadian clock**, **lengthens sleep latency** and **reduces morning alertness** vs. paper book. [Chang et al., *PNAS*, 2015](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1418490112)  
- **Caffeine.** **400 mg** taken **6 h** before bedtime **reduce** **TST** and impair sleep quality; significant effects also at 3 h and near bedtime. [Drake et al., *J Clin Sleep Med*, 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3805807/)  
  - Quantitative synthesis: on average **−45 min** TST, **−7%** efficiency, **+9 min** SOL with caffeine (meta-analysis). [Gardiner et al., *Sleep Med*, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079223000205)  
- **Alcohol.** May facilitate falling asleep, but **fragments sleep** and **alters REM/SWS**, especially in the second half of the night. [Thakkar, *Alcohol Res Health*, 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4427543/)

## Operational guidelines (evidence-based)

> Goal: **7–9 h** (adults), with **regularity** and **quality**. [AASM/CDC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4434546/), [CDC 2024](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html)

1. **Regularity first.** Wake up at **the same time** 7/7; build sleep window accordingly. [AASM Position, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8494094/)  
2. **Sleep hygiene (AASM).** Relaxing pre-sleep routine; bed only for sleep/sex; if not asleep in **~20 min**, get up and do a quiet activity; limit naps (avoid after 3 pm). [AASM – Healthy Sleep Habits](https://sleepeducation.org/healthy-sleep/healthy-sleep-habits/)  
3. **Light.** **Reduce blue light** 1–2 h before sleep (avoid e-reader/phone); in the morning **expose yourself to natural light** to anchor rhythm. [Chang 2015 PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1418490112)  
4. **Stimulants & alcohol.** **Stop caffeine ≥6 h** before sleep; **avoid alcohol** in evening hours. [Drake 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3805807/); [Thakkar 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4427543/)  
5. **Environment.** Bedroom **dark, quiet, cool**; reduce parasitic noise/light (mask, earplugs, blackout curtains). [CDC 2024](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html)  
6. **If problem persists.** Assess **OSA**, chronic insomnia (CBT-I is first-line), circadian rhythm disorders. [AASM Practice Guidelines](https://aasm.org/clinical-resources/practice-standards/practice-guidelines/)

## A simple protocol (measurable)

- **Phase 1 — Reset (14 days).**  
  - **Fixed wake-time** (±15 min) every day.  
  - **Caffeine:** 0 after **8 h** from wake-up. [Drake 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3805807/)  
  - **Screens:** no e-reader/phone in final **2 h** (replace with music/paper book). [Chang 2015](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1418490112)  
  - **Room:** total darkness + light noise masking if needed. [CDC 2024](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html)

- **Phase 2 — Stabilize (4–8 weeks).**  
  - Maintain **7–9 h** with regularity; monitor with diary/actigraphy. [AASM/CDC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4434546/)  
  - **Naps:** ≤20–30 min, not late. [AASM – Healthy Habits](https://sleepeducation.org/healthy-sleep/healthy-sleep-habits/)

- **Realistic expectations (on average):**  
  - **Alertness**: progressive improvement within 7–14 days if moving from 6 h→7–8 h/night. [Van Dongen 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12683469/)  
  - **Immunity**: lower respiratory infection risk vs. ≤6 h/night. [Prather 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4531403/)  
  - **Cognitive/memory**: benefits in consolidation with stable SWS. [Rasch & Born 2013](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/physrev.00032.2012)

## TL;DR (mini-pill for the card)

Sleeping **≥7 h** with **regular timing** is a lever of longevity: during sleep the brain **“self-cleans”** (glymphatic), **consolidates memory**, and the body **repairs**. Avoid **caffeine ≤6 h** and **evening screens**, keep the room **dark/cool**. Measurable benefits on alertness, immunity, and cardiometabolic health.
